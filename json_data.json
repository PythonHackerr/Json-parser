Put them into a saucepan and cover with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Fry until the fruit begins to release juice and the sugar dissolves. We put the vessel in the fridge. Combine the cream, mascarpone cheese and 3 tablespoons of sugar with each other and leave to cool. After a dozen or so minutes, remove the vessel with the creamy mass from the refrigerator and mix it for 2 minutes. Combine it with strawberries, mix it and put it in the freezer for 6 hours. Every hour, it is worth taking the mass out and mixing it. After that, all you have to do is enjoy homemade ice cream."
